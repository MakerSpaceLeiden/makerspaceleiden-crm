Folks,
{%if postDeadline %}
The following items are nearing their deadline and have not been claimed. So make
sure you claim your property back; as otherwise these will be free for others to
claim, and if not claimed quick enough, be disposed.

{%for item in postDeadline %}-  {{ item.description }}
     Deadline {{ item.deadline }}
     Will be disposed {{ item.dispose_by_date }}
     <{{item.url }}>
{%endfor%}
By the way - if something is yours - and you do not want it anymore; then do feel to
mark it as 'can be disposed'. {%endif%}
{%if postDisposeline %}
Know that the items listed below are now past their 'claim by' deadline - or have
already been marked 'to be disposed'. So if you have some time; be so kind to dump
the items marked 'to be disposed' in the container or drop them off at the Kringloop
next door. And then mark them 'gone' in the UFO application.

{%for item in postDisposeline %}-  {{ item.description }}
     Will be disposed {{ item.dispose_by_date }}
     <{{item.url }}>
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
Your friendly makerbot.
