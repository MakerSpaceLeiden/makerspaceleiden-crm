Folks,
{%if postDeadline %}
The following items are nearing its deadline and has not been claimed. So make
sure you claim your property back; as otherwise it will be free for others to
claim, and if not claimed quick enough, be disposed.

{%for item in postDeadline %}-  {{ item.description }}
     Deadline {{ item.deadline }}
     Will be disposed {{ item.dispose_by_date }}
     <{{item.url }}>
{%endfor%}
By the way - if something is yours - and you do not want it anymore; then do feel to
mark it as 'can be disposed'. {%endif%}
{%if postDisposeline %}
Know that the item listed below is now past its 'dispose by' deadline or has been
marked as can be disposed by the owner. So if you have some time; be so kind to dump
it in the container or drop them off at the Kringloop next door. And then mark them
'gone' in the CRM.

{%for item in postDisposeline %}-  {{ item.description }}
     <{{item.url }}>
{%endfor%}
{%endif%}
Your friendly makerbot.
