Dear {{ rq.owner }},

{{ user }} has {% if created %}requested{% else %}updated the information for{% endif %} storage 
that you, as the owner, are now responsible for:

	  {{ rq.what }}

   Owner: {{ rq.owner }}
Location: {{ rq.location }}
   Until: {{ rq.lastdate }} ({{ rq.duration }} days)

          {{ rq.extra_info }}

{% if rq.state == 'R' %}
This request requires the approval from the members of this mailing list. 

Until then you will need to wait. If've you've already stored it at the space; then
you should really remove it again; and beware that others may recycle or bin it if
they find it to be in the way or useful for their project.
{% elif rq.state == 'AG' %}
As this is (the first) request for short term storage of this item; it has been
automatically approved for thirty days.
{% elif rq.state == '1st' %}
This is is a request for an extension of the initial 30 days. It will be automatically
approved in 5 days unless objections are raised.
{% elif rq.state == 'OK' %}
This request has been approved (by the deelnemers@ or the trustees).
{% elif rq.state == 'NO' %}
This request has been rejected. If already at the space {{what}}
should be removed from the space as soon as possible (and becomes
fair game to re-use or throw in the bin after 5 days).
{% elif rq.state == 'R' %}
This request ha been rescinded -- the storage spae is no longer needed.
{% endif %}

Thanks,

Your Caring Makerbot.
