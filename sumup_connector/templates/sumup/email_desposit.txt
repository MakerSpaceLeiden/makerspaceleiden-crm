Subject: [makerbot] Sumup deposit for {{ tx.amount }} -- {{ label }}
L.S.

Just to let you know; we recorded the following despoit into your account:

  from   {{ src_label }}
    to   {{ dst_label }}

  when   {{ tx.date }}

         {{ tx.amount }}

         {{ tx.description}}

You should see this appear on your bank account under, usually, the name:

         SumUp* Stichtig Makerspace Leiden

SumUp is the name of payment provider. Should it be a different name - let
the treasurer know. We're still trying to understand how exactly this works.

Should this be wrong; let one of the trustee's know at {{ settings.TRUSTEES }}. The
full details of this transaction can be seen at {{ base }}{% url 'transactiondetail' pk=tx.pk  %}.
This is also the place where you can delete a transaction.

Or consult your personal page at:

        {{ base }}{% url 'mytransactions' %}

Your friendly makerbot.
