Subject: [makerbot] Sumup deposit for {{ tx.amount }} -- {{ label }}
L.S.

Just to let you know; we recorded the following despoit into your account on {{ tx.date }}:

         {{ actual_amount }}

The actual amount charged is to your bank/credit card is {{ tx.amount }}.  The amount deposited is lower, i.e. {{ actual_amount }}, as we need to pay a fee of {{ fee }} to the bank.

You should see this appear on your bank account under, usually, the name:

         SumUp* Stichtig Makerspace Leiden

SumUp is the name of payment provider. Should it be a different name - let the treasurer know. We're still trying to understand how exactly this works.

Should this be wrong; let one of the trustee's know at {{ settings.TRUSTEES }}. The full details of this transaction can be seen at {{ base }}{% url 'transactiondetail' pk=tx.pk  %}.  This is also the place where you can delete a transaction.

Or consult your personal page at:

        {{ base }}{% url 'mytransactions' %}

Your friendly makerbot.
