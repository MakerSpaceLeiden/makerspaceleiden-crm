Subject: [makerbot] Sumup deposit failed
L.S.

Just to let you know; deposit {{ checkout.pk }} failed.

The error is unfortunately a bit technical:

     {{ error }}

as it is not appears not to be a simple case of
an rejected credit, debit or banking-cart, or
the loss of connectivity to our Sumup payment
provider.  So the treasurer has been emailed
to look at this (reference {{ checkout.pk }}).

Your friendly makerbot.
