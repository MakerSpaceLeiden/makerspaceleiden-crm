Petty Cash admins,

This is to let you know that a somewhat unusual number (more than {{ settings.PETTYCASH_TERMS_MAX_UNKNOWN }}) of failed join attempts queued up.

Hopefully this is as someone is debugging or fixing something. But it may also be the result of some hacking/brute force attack on the tags (as they se are relatively short; some as short as 32 bits) and hence can be brute forced.

A list is below.

Your spacebot,
