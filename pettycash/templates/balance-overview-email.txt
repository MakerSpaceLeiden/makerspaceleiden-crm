Subject: [makerbot] Everyones account balances for this month

Folks,

It is that time of the month again. Your spacebot has been doing the
sums; and below the balances of everyone that did a transaction in the
last month together with everyone that owes money to the space and really
should do a deposit as soon as possible.

As always - you can see the complete list at

	{{ base }}{% url 'balances' %}

where you can also browse to the specific transactions.  And here you
can also fix any mistakes.

If you are not on this list - then you propably did not do any
transaction (this month, or ever) -and- do do not owe the space
any money at this point in time.

Or consult your personal page at:

	{{ base }}{% url 'mytransactions' %}

for just your own transactions. With regard to the deposits into the
bank acount; last import of the bank-statements with your deposits was
done on {{ last_import.date}} by {{ last_import.by }}.

As a general rule (and depending on your coffee, nuts, welding gas and
bolts appetite) consider doing a deposit of 5 or 10 euro when you are
getting below 5 euro or so.

Yours,

the makerspace bot, on behalf of the trustees (bestuur@makerspaceleiden.nl).
