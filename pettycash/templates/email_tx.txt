Subject: [makerbot] Cash transaction for {{ tx.amount }} -- {{ label }}
L.S.

Just to let you know; we had the following transaction made:

  from   {{ src_label }}
    to   {{ dst_label }}

  when   {{ tx.date }}

         {{ tx.amount }}

         {{ tx.description}}

Should this be wrong; let one of the trustee's know at {{ settings.TRUSTEES }}. The
full details of this transaction can be seen at {{ base }}{% url 'transactiondetail' pk=tx.pk  %}.
This is also the place where you can delete a transaction.

Or consult your personal page at:

        {{ base }}{% url 'mytransactions' %}

Which is where you can also deposit extra money into your account.

Your friendly makerbot.
