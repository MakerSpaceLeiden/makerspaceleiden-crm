Subject:  "[pettycash/claims] {{ subject }} @ MSL

This is to notify you that there was an unexpected issue with a
deferred payment at terminal {{ terminal.name }}, {{ station.description }}.
{% if e %}
The error/exception was:
      {{ e }}
{% else %}
      {{ subject }}
{% endif %}
The main data is:

    Claim:    {{ nonce_str }}
    POST/GET: {% for key, value in rq.items %}
              {{ key }} : {{ value }}{% endfor %}

This happened during settling - and as it failed - won't be visible
in the log of claims/payments. Any remedy will need to be done as
a manual payment via the web interface.

Your,
