Hi {{ user.first_name }},

This is a (regular) update that one of the permissions that was filed after instruction
by {{ instructor }} for {{ machine }} is waiting for:

{% if waiver %}
  * the waiver to be filed by you.
    See {% url 'waiverform' user_id=user.id %}
{% fi %}
{% if trustees %}
  * approval by the trustees.
{% fi %}

If you have questionsl you can contact the Trustees directly in person, via
{{ trustees_email }} or by phone.

With kind regards,
