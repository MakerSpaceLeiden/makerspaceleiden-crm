Hi {{ user.first_name }},

This is a (regular) update that one of the permissions that was filed after instruction
by {{ instructor }} for {{ machine }} is waiting for:

{% if not waiver %}  * the waiver to be filed by you.
    see {% url 'waiverform' user_id=user.id %}

{% endif %}{% if not trustees %}  * approval by the trustees.

{% endif %}If you have questionsl you can contact the Trustees directly in person, via
{{ trustees_email }} or by phone.

With kind regards,
