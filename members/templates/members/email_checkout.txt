Hello {{user.first_name}},

It looks like you might have forgotten to checkout at the space yesterday?

According to the logs you entered the space at {{user.onsite_updated_at}},
but there's no trace of a checkout.

Checking out is useful so that other people know when to expect other fellow makers at the space,
and it allows me to provide useful reminders, like if the lights are still on when the last person leaves.

Checking out can be done when you leave, by simply swiping your card again, while you hold the door open on your way out.

Or it can also be done via the Space State page: {{url_space_state}}
page: {{url_notification_settings}}

Your friendly makerbot.
