Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Welcome to the Makerspace Leiden !

1)	Next - set a password on your account in our system; so you get
	access to the Wifi and so on.

	Your username will be your email address ({{ user.get_username }}).

	Click on the link below to set your password:

	{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

	If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new
	browser window instead.

	If that fails too - contact 'noc@makerspaceleiden.nl' for help.

2)	Once you are logged in; go to

	{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'index' %}

	and navigate to 'your data'. Double check the spelling of your name
	and other details.

	Consider uploading a picture - to help people know you.

3)	You will also have been subscribed to two mailing lists; `deelnemeners'
        and `spacelog'.

	The first, `deelnemers' is used for all communication between participants.
	For example when someone wants help (or instruction) with a machine.

 	It can be high volume at times - so you may want to use a filter in your
	mailtool to send it to a certain folder; or follow the link under each
	email to switch to `digest' -- where the flow is reduced to just one email
	per day with a summary.

4)	Next you will want to go to the wiki  {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }} --> Wiki.

	Here - read at the very least the first page; and in particular the 'Safety and
 	Noise' section and the 'Procedures and Principles'. Safety is not optional.

	And some machines absolutely require mandatory instruction.

5)	If you want to use category 1 and 2 machines (the two most dangerous classes,
 	these include the large three phase powered woodworking machines) - then
	be sure to ask & arrange for instructions on the deelnemers@ mailing list.

	And also go to {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'index' %},
	navigate to `your data'; sign and print out the waiver form and
	(hand) deliver it to the address on the form.

6)	Most people write a short introduction email to deelnemers@. Please do so too. 
	Tell us a bit about yourself, what you like to make, what machines you are 
	interested in, and what you hope to get out of the Makerspace.

7)	It is likely that you will want to claim some storage space; a 'box'. On
	the page  {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'index' %} -> Members
	Box Management - you can check if there is still an empty slot. There are
	usually empty boxes spare; or bring your own box that fits. If there is
	no space -- ask for assistance on the deelnemers@ list - we can usually
	liberate space with ease.

8)	We generally have an open-house on the first monday of the month. That
	always needs help.

	We have a `ask anyone anything' evening every Tuesday evening from about
	20:00. Here you can get help with a new machine; meet other people and
	sometimes someone will show how to use a new machine or a trick
	recently discovered.

	Finally - at times you will see calls to action on the deelnemens@
	mailing list. E.g. for the large cleanups, or some project to improve
	something at the space. This is usually a good time to get to meet
	the other members.

If you have any trouble getting any of this to work - simply reply to this email; or contact
the trustees at hetbestuur@makerspaceleiden.nl

Have fun making !

Your friendly makerbot.
