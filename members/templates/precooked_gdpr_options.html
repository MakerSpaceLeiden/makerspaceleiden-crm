As per our privacy policy (and the regulation that implements the GDPR, de Algemene Verordening	Gegevensbescherming) we balance
the individuals privacy with needs of the Stichting, the collective, to manage the community.
<p>
Now at times, it will be, nessesary for Trustees, or those that have been delegated certain tasks, to interact
with privacy sensitive informtion about outs. For example to update some-ones record; or to check that something
has happened.
<p>
As part of the checks and balances required by this regulation - we keep track of who accesses what information; and especially
why this was needed; and we need to minimise this as much as possible.
<p>
