Membersbox {{location}} of {{ name }} put up for re-use; any contents left in it will soon be junked/recycled.

Dear {{ owner }},

The storage location {{ location }} was marked for re-use {% if owner %}{% if owner != user %} by {{ user }}{% endif %}{% endif %}.

If there is any junk left in it; be sure to get, or ask for, it within a few days - as otherwise it wil be thrown away or recycled soon.

Yours,
